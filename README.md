HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for structuring the content of the website, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and formatting.

1) We have two forms, one for login and one for registration. Each form contains input fields for username, password (and email for registration), and a submit button. and Each input field has a corresponding label for accessibility. The forms are wrapped in a container div for styling purposes.
Styles the overall layout with a centered container for the forms.
Styles the forms with a white background, some padding, and a box-shadow for a card-like effect.
Defines styles for form headings, labels, input fields, and buttons.

2)  The structure of the website will consist of multiple sections such as:
Header: Contains your name/logo and navigation links.
About Me: A brief introduction about yourself.
Skills: List of your technical skills or areas of expertise.
Projects: Showcase of your past projects with descriptions and links.
